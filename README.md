## Project Overview
The IoT-Based Water Level Monitoring System addresses challenges in water resource management by using IoT technology for real-time monitoring. This system offers an efficient, cost-effective solution for collecting and analyzing water level data, enabling proactive management and decision-making for sustainable practices.

## Problem Statement
Traditional methods of monitoring water levels are often manual, slow, and lack real-time accuracy. This project aims to provide an automated, scalable solution for real-time water level monitoring, addressing:
1. Limited real-time data.
2. Delayed decision-making.
3. Environmental risks (flooding, droughts).
4. Resource constraints in data collection.

## Objectives
- Enable real-time monitoring with accurate data collection.
- Integrate with existing water management infrastructure.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for data visualization and control.
- Send alerts during abnormal water level changes.
- Ensure system scalability for various applications.
